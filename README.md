- My name is CombatPompano :P

I like coding, solving math problems, and gaming in my free time. I am learning HTML, CSS, JS, React.js, Node.js, C++, Java, Python, WebGL 2, and SDL 2.

I am familar with the popular frameworks Django, Ruby On Rails, and SCSS. I am currently using 3D Game Engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine 4/5.

If you would like to contact me, you can DM me on Discord (Pompano#5388), comment on one of my Khan Academy programs (Username is CombatPompano), or directly email me on Gmail (miststego@gmail.com) 

In past lives, I developed programs @ Scratch, and was part of a coding group called "The Angle Brackets".
